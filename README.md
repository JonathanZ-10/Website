Portfolio Website
===================
This is my own personal portfolio website, the first ever time working with HTML/CSS and a challenge I chose to face head on. It is purely 100% HTML/CSS in order to provide an even greater challenge, this is done without the support from Javascript or React, Angular, and any other libraries which could have helped ease the process. The goal was to make a simplistic website which provided information similar to that of a resume as well as a list of the major projects I have worked on. The website also displays my coding skills and the challenge that it was to code and design a website on my own.

## Specifications
Language: HTML / CSS

IDE: Microsoft Visual Studio Code

Project Length: ~1.5 months

Coder & Designer: Jonathan Zamora

## Features
- Three Pages with seemless transitions
- Interactable buttons with proper hover effects
- Information on about me, skills, projects, and a method of contacting me
- Important: Very smooth and interactable UI

## TODO
- Final Touches to ensure everything works
- Scalablity to mobile platforms

## Experience
From this project I learned much about designing and programming a website purely from sratch only using HTML and CSS. The first challenge I faced was designing the website in my mind before even starting to code. After starting from scratch two times, the third time is the final user-friendly UI we now see. The next hurdle I faced was time management and planning, at the time of this project I was nearing finals for my last semester so I had to manage time between the project and finals without allowing the project length to vastly increase. This was a matter of focusing mainly on my classes and on my sparetime, on coding the website.

Overall, it was an enjoyable experience and it's something that I truly enjoyed coding and bringing to life. After much time and work I created a website that I deem sufficient and satisfactory for a first ever website. In the future I plan on creating yet another website, one which will properly present the improvement in my coding over-time.
